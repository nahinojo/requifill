## **Issues**

### Popup 

- Save Changes banner blocks everything!
- Field does not unfocus on pressing keyboard 'Enter'

### Requisition Form Manipulation

- Multivalue fields are not autofilled onto screen, nor are they even scrollable

## **Features**

### Storage

### Documentation & Advertise

[ Wait until project is more fleshed out before completing]
- Fill out the README.md in detail.
- Make a website for this extension.


### Popup

[ See design on Figma ]
- Enable/Disable fields to be multivalue
- Clearall values? Remove all fields?


### Requisition Form Manipulation

- Add a visual indicator that the input field contains scrollable values. Maybe an icon or change of styling?
- Autofill expected value when typing. Maybe include a dropdown for scrolling?
- Finer decimal scroll when holding down the shift key

### Other Capabilities

- Copy/paste from merchandise store (Amazon, Newegg, Digikey) to KFS document.
- Copy/paste from submitted KFS document to purchase logbook.
